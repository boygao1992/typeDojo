typing exercises

character sets 
- Numeric characters (`0123456789`)
- Special characters (`~!@#$%^&()_+-={}[];\',.`, `*|` missing)

`yarn start`

# Guideline

Note taking in latex is smoother but missing `*` and `|` in training.

Need a better symbol generator.

TODO
- build a composable random number generator
  - Linear cogruential generator (LCG)
- build common distributions on top of that
- generate from customized set of symbols

Performance kind of stabilized.
Need to target the poorly-handled subset of symbols.

No enough data collected during the exercises.
One way is to build a web app for this.

By mental statistics, `%^&` was mistyped most frequently.
For `23@#`, sometimes not using the optimal finger.

Left `shift` and right `shift` switching needs some work.

Current strategy is to switch hand when the other one is "busy".
An exception: `6` or `^` is right in the middle of left and right hands.
When typing a sequence like `^6^`, there is no need to switch hands but press and release `shift` by the same hand.
